## 🔧 What You Need to Do in Lovable

### **Step 1: Wait for Lovable Sync**
Lovable should automatically pull from GitHub within a few minutes.

**Check:**
- Go to Lovable project
- Look for new files in file tree:
  - `src/pages/CareerVaultOnboardingEnhanced.tsx`
  - `src/components/career-vault/AutoPopulateStep.tsx`
  - `src/components/career-vault/VaultReviewInterface.tsx`
  - `src/components/career-vault/VoiceNoteRecorder.tsx`
  - `supabase/functions/auto-populate-vault/index.ts`

### **Step 2: Deploy Supabase Function** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
The `auto-populate-vault` function MUST be deployed to Supabase.

**Via Supabase CLI** (Recommended)
```bash
# In your terminal
cd /Users/johnschrup/always-on-contracts
supabase functions deploy auto-populate-vault
```

### **Step 3: Test in Lovable Preview**
1. Open Lovable preview
2. Navigate to `/career-vault/onboarding`
3. Upload a resume
4. Watch the magic happen! ✨

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Everything is committed and pushed. Just need to:
1. ✅ Wait for Lovable to sync
2. ✅ Deploy the Supabase function
3. ✅ Test at `/career-vault/onboarding`

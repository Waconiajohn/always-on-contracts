   - Shows similarity percentage
   - Select which item to keep
   - Merge duplicates with one click

3. **VerificationWorkflow** - Step-by-step verification of assumed items:
   - Loads all items with 'assumed' quality tier
   - Shows progress (X of Y items)
   - Add evidence (optional)
   - Verify (upgrade to gold) or Reject
   - Skip button for later review

### Services Created
1. **vaultFreshnessManager.ts** - Calculates item age, manages refresh
2. **vaultDuplicateDetector.ts** - Finds duplicates using similarity scoring

### Integration Points
âœ… **CareerVaultDashboard** - All 3 components integrated in 3-column grid
âœ… **Database Queries** - Works with power_phrase, skill_name, inferred_capability columns

# Career Vault Enhancement - AI Auto-Population System

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Problem Solved**: The original Career Vault required 45-60 minutes of manual Q&A, creating friction for busy executives.

**Solution**: AI-powered auto-population that extracts comprehensive career intelligence in 10-15 minutes.

**Impact**:
- **75% time reduction** (60 min → 15 min)
- **Higher completion rates** (easier = more users finish)
- **Better data quality** (AI infers hidden insights humans miss)
- **Improved UX** (review vs create = less cognitive load)

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. AI Auto-Population (`auto-populate-vault`)

**What it does**:
- Analyzes resume with comprehensive prompt
- Extracts 20-50 power phrases minimum
- Identifies 20-40 transferable skills
- Infers 10-25 hidden competencies
- Captures 15-30 soft skills
- Extracts intangibles (leadership, presence, values)

**How it works**:
```typescript
// Call the function
const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke('auto-populate-vault', {
  body: {
    vaultId: 'uuid',
    resumeText: 'full resume text...',
    targetRoles: ['VP Engineering', 'CTO'],
    targetIndustries: ['FinTech', 'SaaS']
  }
});

// Returns
{
  success: true,
  totalExtracted: 156,
  categories: ['powerPhrases', 'transferableSkills', ...],
  vaultCompletion: 85,
  summary: {
    strengthAreas: ['Technical Leadership', 'P&L Management'],
    uniqueDifferentiators: ['Rare tech+finance background'],
    confidence: 'high'
  }
}
```

### 2. Review Interface (`VaultReviewInterface`)

**User Experience**:
- See one item at a time
- Three actions: ✅ Approve | ✏️ Edit | ❌ Skip
- Progress tracking (shows X of Y reviewed)
- Inline editing for corrections
- Takes 5-10 minutes for 100+ items

**Example**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Power Phrase | 85% confidence   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ "Increased annual revenue by    │
│ 45% ($2.3M) in 18 months by     │
│ launching new product line"     │
│                                 │
│ Context: VP Product at TechCo   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Skip] [Edit] [✓ Approve]      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Voice Notes (`VoiceNoteRecorder`)

**Use Cases**:
- Fill gaps AI missed
- Add details for specific experiences
- Easier than typing for some users

**How it works**:
1. User clicks "Start Recording"
2. Browser speech recognition transcribes live
3. User clicks "Stop" when done
4. AI extracts intelligence from transcript
5. Auto-adds to vault

**Technology**:
- Uses browser's Web Speech API (free, fast)
- Real-time transcription display
- Calls `extract-vault-intelligence` to process

## 🛠️ Technical Considerations

### Supabase Function Limits
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds max (current extraction takes ~30s)
- **Token Limits**: 16K max tokens (plenty for resumes)
- **Cost**: ~$0.03 per vault auto-population (Claude Sonnet 4)

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel database inserts (Promise.allSettled)
- Caching resume analysis (content hash)
- Progressive loading in review interface

### Error Handling
- Retry logic for API failures
- Graceful degradation to manual interview
- Clear error messages with suggested solutions

   - AI synthesizes across all documents

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Vault improves over time as user applies to jobs
   - "Tell me about X" prompts when relevant

3. **Collaborative Intelligence**
   - Ask colleagues to validate/add to vault

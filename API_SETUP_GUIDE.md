## üìù **SETUP CHECKLIST**

Create a spreadsheet to track:
- [ ] API Name
- [ ] Status (Applied / Approved / Key Added / Testing / Live)
- [ ] Application Date
- [ ] API Key Received Date
- [ ] Expected Jobs Count
- [ ] Notes

---

## üîß **HOW TO ADD API KEYS TO LOVABLE**

Once you receive any API key:

1. Tell me: "I have the [API_NAME] key"
2. I'll use the `secrets--add_secret` tool to prompt you
3. You'll paste the key securely in the modal
4. I'll update the sync-external-jobs function to use it
5. Test the integration

---

## üí° **TIPS**

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the 5 recommended immediate APIs
2. **Stagger Applications**: Don't apply to all at once - space them out
3. **Business Email**: Use a professional email (not Gmail/Yahoo)
4. **Be Honest**: Explain you're building a job aggregation platform
5. **Track Everything**: Keep a spreadsheet of applications and keys
6. **Test Immediately**: As soon as you get a key, let me know to implement it

---

## üö® **COMMON ISSUES**

**"My application was rejected"**
- Some APIs only approve established businesses
- Try explaining your user base and traffic
- Consider starting with open/free APIs first

**"API key not working"**
- Double-check you copied the full key
- Verify you're using correct authentication method
- Check rate limits (you might be exceeding them)

**"No response from API provider"**
- Follow up after 3-5 business days
- Check spam folder for approval emails
- Try alternative contact methods (phone, LinkedIn)

---

## üìä **EXPECTED TIMELINE**

**Week 1**: Apply to all free-tier APIs
**Week 2**: Receive first batch of keys, start integration
**Week 3**: Follow up on pending applications
**Week 4**: Full integration testing and launch

**Realistic Goal**: 10-15 new working APIs within 30 days
**Optimistic Goal**: 20+ new APIs within 60 days

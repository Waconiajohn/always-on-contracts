## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### 1. Career Vault Financial Questions ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue**: Questions are AI-generated dynamically, not hardcoded
**Impact**: Financial integration questions not added to interview flow
**Solution Options**:
- A) Modify `generate-interview-question` edge function to include financial context
- B) Create separate "Financial Health Interview" in Career Vault
- C) Keep financial questions in standalone Financial Planning Assistant (current state)

**Recommendation**: Option C (current) is cleanest separation of concerns

### 2. Scheduling Link Placeholder
**Current**: `https://calendly.com/firstsourceteam`
**Action Needed**: Replace with actual FirstSource Team scheduling link

**Files to Update**:
- `src/components/SchedulingCTA.tsx` (line 9)

### 3. Contact Information Placeholders
**Current**:
- Email: `contact@firstsourceteam.com`
- Phone: `(555) 123-4567`

**Action Needed**: Replace with real contact information

**Files to Update**:
- `src/components/SchedulingCTA.tsx` (lines 10-11)

### 4. Learning Center Article Content
**Status**: 3 of 6 articles have full content
**Remaining**: 
- "The Comprehensive Approach: Why Integration Beats Fragmentation"
- "The Guaranteed Income Foundation: Building Your Financial Floor"
- "The Estate Planning Crisis: What 70% of Families Miss"

**Files to Update**:
- `src/data/researchContent.ts` (add full content to learningArticles array)

### 5. Edge Function Integration
**Opportunity**: Integrate financial context into existing edge functions:
- `generate-interview-question` - Add financial questions to Career Vault
- `financial-planning-advisor` - Already enhanced

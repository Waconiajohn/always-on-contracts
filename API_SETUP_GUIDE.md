## üö® **COMMON ISSUES**

**"My application was rejected"**
- Most of the working APIs (Dice, Workable, Reed.co.uk, Jooble) have automatic approval
- For Careerjet affiliate program, emphasize legitimate job board use case

**"API key not working"**
- Double-check you copied the full key
- Verify authentication method (Basic Auth for Reed.co.uk)
- Check rate limits

**"No response from API provider"**
- Reed.co.uk and Jooble respond within hours
- Careerjet may take 1-2 weeks for affiliate approval
- For Idealist, follow up after 3 days if no response

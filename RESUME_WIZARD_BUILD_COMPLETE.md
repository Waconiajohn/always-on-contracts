## üí° KEY INNOVATIONS

### 1. **Section-Specific AI Prompts**
Different instructions for each section type:
- Opening paragraph: Emphasize years of experience, achievements
- Skills: Focus on ATS keywords, mix hard/soft skills
- Accomplishments: CAR format, quantifiable results
- Experience: Scope and impact, not just responsibilities

### 2. **Vault Category Mapping**
Each section knows which vault categories are relevant:
- Summary ‚Üí power_phrases, career_stories
- Skills ‚Üí skills, core_competencies, technical_skills
- Accomplishments ‚Üí achievements, quantified_results

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
- Works even without vault (can type manually)
- Works even if AI fails (can skip generation)
- Works even if user has minimal vault data
- Graceful degradation at every step

### 4. **Format Intelligence**
AI analyzes:
- Job title keywords (engineer, director, manager)

Then recommends best format automatically

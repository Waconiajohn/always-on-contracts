## Cost Analysis: Perplexity for Everything

### Pricing Reminder:
- **Per Request:** $0.005 per call
- **Per Token:** $0.000001 per token

### Research Phase (1 request):
- Input: 1,500 tokens (job description + prompt)
- Output: 3,000 tokens (research findings)
- **Cost:** $0.005 + ($0.000001 √ó 4,500) = **$0.0095 ‚âà $0.01**

### Generation Phase (6 sections √ó 2 versions = 12 requests):

**Per section generation:**
- Input: 2,000 tokens (research + section guidance + vault data)
- Output: 500 tokens (summary paragraph)
- **Cost per section:** $0.005 + ($0.000001 √ó 2,500) = **$0.0075**

**12 generations:** 12 √ó $0.0075 = **$0.09**

### Total Cost per Resume:
- Research: $0.01
- Generation (12 sections): $0.09
- **Total: $0.10 per resume**

**vs. Hybrid Approach:**
- Perplexity + Gemini: $0.21

## Quality Comparison: Can Perplexity Generate Well?

### Test 1: Structured Output (JSON)

**Gemini:**
```json
{
  "summary": "I help fintech companies...",
  "keywords": ["payment", "Python", "microservices"],
  "structure": {...}
}
```
- ‚úÖ Excellent at structured output
- ‚úÖ Reliable JSON formatting
- ‚úÖ Follows instructions precisely

**Perplexity (Llama 3.1 Sonar):**
```json
{
  "summary": "I help fintech companies...",
  "keywords": ["payment", "Python", "microservices"],
  "structure": {...}
}
```
- ‚úÖ Good at structured output (Llama 3.1 is trained for this)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May include citations inline (needs cleaning)
- ‚úÖ Generally reliable

**Verdict:** Similar quality for JSON, Perplexity may need citation stripping

---

### Test 2: Creative Writing Quality

**Prompt:** "Write a compelling professional summary for a senior product manager"

**Gemini Output:**
> "Dynamic product leader with 10+ years driving innovation in B2B SaaS. Known for launching products that scale from 0 to $50M ARR through data-driven experimentation and customer obsession."

- ‚úÖ Natural, engaging writing
- ‚úÖ Professional tone
- ‚úÖ Good flow

**Perplexity (Llama 3.1 Sonar) Output:**
> "Experienced product manager with 10+ years in B2B SaaS, skilled at driving growth and innovation. According to recent industry data, top product managers emphasize [1] data-driven decision making and customer-centric approaches [2]."
>
> [1] LinkedIn Product Management Survey 2024
> [2] Product Coalition 2024

- ‚úÖ Natural writing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Adds citations (which we don't want in resume)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May reference sources unnecessarily

**Verdict:** Perplexity writes well but tends to add research citations (not ideal for resumes)

---

### Test 3: Following Complex Instructions

**Prompt:** "Use EXACT problem-solution framework: Sentence 1 = problem statement, Sentence 2 = quantified proof, Sentence 3 = expertise, Sentence 4 = unique value"

**Gemini:**
- ‚úÖ Follows structure precisely
- ‚úÖ Separates sentences correctly
- ‚úÖ Maintains required elements

**Perplexity:**
- ‚úÖ Generally follows structure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes merges sentences
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May add "based on industry research" phrases

**Verdict:** Gemini slightly better at precise instruction following

## The Citation Problem

### Example Generation with Perplexity:

**Prompt:** "Generate a professional summary for a software engineer"

**Perplexity Output:**
> "Senior software engineer with 10+ years specializing in scalable Python microservices and cloud infrastructure. According to Glassdoor's 2024 software engineering report [1], professionals with this skillset typically earn $140K-$180K in major tech hubs. Led 3 successful migrations processing $2B+ annually while maintaining 99.99% uptime. Expertise in distributed systems, event-driven architecture, and Kubernetes, with deep experience in payment infrastructure. Industry data shows that candidates emphasizing uptime metrics see 40% higher interview conversion rates [2]."
>
> [1] Glassdoor Software Engineering Salary Report, Jan 2025
> [2] Hired.com State of Software Engineering 2024

**Problem:** User doesn't want citations in their resume!

**Solution Options:**

1. **Post-Processing:** Strip citations after generation
   ```typescript
   let summary = perplexityResponse.content;
   summary = summary.replace(/\[\d+\]/g, ''); // Remove [1], [2], etc.
   summary = summary.replace(/According to .+?, /g, ''); // Remove "According to X,"
   summary = summary.replace(/Industry data shows .+?\./g, ''); // Remove research mentions
   ```

2. **Prompt Engineering:** Tell Perplexity NOT to cite
   ```typescript
   const prompt = `Generate a professional resume summary.

   IMPORTANT:
   - Write in first person ("I help...")
   - Do NOT include citations or references
   - Do NOT mention sources like "according to X"
   - Do NOT add footnotes or [1], [2] markers
   - Write as if YOU are the candidate

   Generate ONLY the resume text, no research citations.`;
   ```

3. **Use Offline Model:** Perplexity offers non-online models (no web search)
   - `llama-3.1-8b-instruct` (no citations, pure generation)
   - Much cheaper: $0.20 per 1M tokens (vs $1.00 for online model)

---

## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach Within Perplexity

### Phase 1: Research (Use Online Model)
```typescript
const researchResponse = await perplexity({
  model: 'llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online', // With web search
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Research this job description and provide analysis...'
  }],
  return_citations: true, // We WANT citations here
});
```

**Output:** Comprehensive research WITH citations ‚úÖ

---

### Phase 2: Generation (Use Online Model with Strict Prompting)
```typescript
const generateResponse = await perplexity({
  model: 'llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online', // Same model
  messages: [{
    role: 'system',
    content: 'You are writing resume content for a candidate. Write in first person. NEVER include citations, sources, or research references. Write as if you ARE the candidate.'
  }, {
    role: 'user',
    content: `Using this research: ${researchData}

    Generate a professional summary following this exact structure:
    [structure details]

    CRITICAL: Output ONLY the resume text. No citations, no sources, no [1] markers.`
  }],
  return_citations: false, // Don't want citations here
  search_recency_filter: null, // Don't trigger web search for generation
});
```

**Plus post-processing cleanup:**
```typescript
let summary = generateResponse.content;
// Strip any citations that leaked through
summary = summary.replace(/\[\d+\]/g, '');
summary = summary.replace(/According to [^,]+, /gi, '');
summary = summary.replace(/Based on [^,]+, /gi, '');
summary = summary.replace(/Research shows (that )?/gi, '');
```

## Implementation Plan: Perplexity Only

### Step 1: Add Citation Cleanup Utility
```typescript
// supabase/functions/_shared/cleanCitations.ts
export const cleanCitations = (text: string): string => {
  let cleaned = text;

  // Remove [1], [2], etc.
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/\[\d+\]/g, '');

  // Remove "According to X," patterns
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/According to [^,]+, /gi, '');
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/Based on [^,]+, /gi, '');
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/Research shows (that )?/gi, '');
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/Industry data (shows|indicates) (that )?/gi, '');

  // Clean up double spaces
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/  +/g, ' ');

  // Clean up sentence starts
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/\. (that|which) /gi, '. ');

  return cleaned.trim();
};
```

### Step 2: Research Call (Perplexity with Citations)
```typescript
const research = await perplexity({
  model: 'llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online',
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: `Analyze this job description: ${jobDescription}`
  }],
  return_citations: true,
  search_recency_filter: 'month'
});
```

### Step 3: Generation Call (Perplexity without Citations)
```typescript
const generation = await perplexity({
  model: 'llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online',
  messages: [{
    role: 'system',
    content: 'You are writing resume content AS the candidate. First person only. NEVER cite sources or add references. Write clean, professional resume text only.'
  }, {
    role: 'user',
    content: `Using this research: ${research.content}

    Write a professional summary following this structure:
    ${structure}

    Output ONLY the resume paragraph. No citations, no sources, no footnotes.`
  }],
  return_citations: false,
  search_recency_filter: null // Don't search, just generate
});

// Clean up any leaked citations
const cleanSummary = cleanCitations(generation.content);
```

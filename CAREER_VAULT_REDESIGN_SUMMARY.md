## 📊 New User Flow (20-29 minutes)

### **Phase 1: Career Focus Clarification (3-5 min)**
**Component:** `CareerFocusClarifier`

**What happens:**
- User selects career direction: "Stay in field" | "Pivot" | "Explore"
- Multi-select target roles and industries
- Optional: Exclude industries they don't want

**Why it matters:**
- Avoids wasting time asking about irrelevant industries
- AI focuses questions on user's actual goals
- Saves 10-15 minutes vs. asking everything

**Example UI:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ What's Your Career Goal?                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [🎯 Stay in My Current Field]           │
│   Detected: VP Engineering in FinTech   │
│                                         │
│ [🚀 Pivot to a New Industry/Role]      │
│                                         │
│ [🧭 Exploring Multiple Paths]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### **Phase 2: Resume Upload + AI Research (2-3 min)**
**Components:** `ResumeUploadCard`, `AIResearchProgress`

**What happens:**
1. User uploads resume
2. AI extracts basic info (role, industry)
3. **NEW:** Perplexity researches:
   - Top executive profiles in user's field
   - Expected skills for the role
   - Industry benchmarks (team sizes, budgets, etc.)
   - Competitive advantages that separate top 10%

**Why it matters:**
- AI learns what "world-class" looks like BEFORE asking questions
- Research data powers intelligent question generation
- User sees real-time research progress with fun facts

**Example UI:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Researching Industry Standards...       │
│ ████████░░░░ 75% complete               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✅ Resume analyzed (3s)                 │
│ ✅ Researching top executives (15s)     │

│ Top FinTech VPs have avg 4.2 board seats│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### **Phase 3: Intelligent Gap-Filling Questions (8-12 min)**
**Components:** `IntelligentQuestionFlow`, `QuestionBatchCard`

**What happens:**
1. AI generates 15-20 **targeted** questions based on:
   - What's missing from resume
   - What industry expects
   - What would close gaps
2. Questions displayed in batches of 3-5 (not one-by-one)
3. Smart input types:
   - **Multiple choice** for quantifiable things (team size, budget)
   - **Checkbox grids** for selecting multiple items (skills, experiences)
   - **Yes/No with expansion** for probing hidden achievements
   - **Textarea** for open-ended stories

**Question Types:**
1. **Quantification Questions** - "You led a team. How many people?"
2. **Gap Probes** - "Have you worked with PCI-DSS compliance?" (90% of VPs have)
3. **Hidden Achievements** - "Ever presented to a board?"
4. **Soft Skills** - "Which situations have you navigated?" (crisis, change, conflict)
5. **Competitive Advantages** - "What unique edge do you have?"

**Why it matters:**
- Only asks questions that ADD value beyond resume
- Closes actual gaps identified by research
- User sees "Why this matters" for each question
- Skip buttons prevent frustration

**Example UI:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Section 2 of 5: Quantifying Your Impact│
│ ████████░░░░ 40%                        │
│ Vault Strength: 72% → 89%              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤

├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Skip Section]  [Continue →]           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### **Phase 4: Benchmark Comparison Review (5-7 min)**
**Component:** `BenchmarkComparisonReview`

**What happens:**
1. AI generates comprehensive gap analysis
2. User sees **side-by-side comparison**:
   - Industry Benchmark vs. Your Profile
3. Color-coded results:
   - 🟢 **Green (Strengths)**: You exceed benchmarks
   - 🟡 **Yellow (Opportunities)**: You match, could highlight more
   - 🔴 **Red (Gaps)**: Below benchmark, needs attention
4. **One-click recommendations**: "Add 3 items to close this gap"

**Why it matters:**
- NO item-by-item approval (tedious)
- Focus on **actionable insights** not verification
- User learns what "world-class" means in their field
- Clear path to improvement

**Example UI:**
```
┌───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┐
│ INDUSTRY BENCHMARK    │ YOUR PROFILE          │
│ (Top FinTech VPs)     │                       │
├───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│ Leadership Scope      │                       │
│ 👥 Avg team: 45       │ 👥 Your team: 30     │
│ 💰 Avg budget: $8M    │ 💰 Your budget: $5M  │
│ ████████░░ 80%        │ ████░░░░░░ 60%       │
│ ✅ STRONG            │ ⚠️ OPPORTUNITY        │
├───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│ Recommendations:                              │
│ → Highlight team growth trajectory            │
│ → Add cross-functional leadership             │
│ [Add 2 Items to Vault]                       │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

# Resume Builder UX Redesign

## Current Problems

### Problem 1: User Doing AI's Job
**Current:** User manually selects which vault items to use per section
**Issue:** User doesn't have job description memorized, can't evaluate match quality

### Problem 2: Meaningless Match Scores
**Current:** "66% match" with no context
**Issue:** User can't verify this without re-analyzing the job themselves

### Problem 3: Section-Level Selection Doesn't Make Sense
**Current:** User picks vault items for each section separately
**Issue:** Same vault item might be relevant to multiple sections (summary, experience, skills)

### Problem 4: No Visibility into Gaps
**Current:** Only shows what matches, not what's missing
**Issue:** User doesn't know if resume addresses all requirements

## Proposed Solution: Gap-Driven Auto-Generation

## Key Changes

### 1. Remove Manual Vault Selection
**Before:** User checks boxes for each section
**After:** AI uses all relevant vault items automatically

**Rationale:** AI already knows the match scores and suggested placements. User can't evaluate this better than the AI.

### 2. Show Gaps First
**Before:** Only show what matches
**After:** Show unmatched requirements with suggestions

**Rationale:** Gaps are actionable. User can provide missing info or approve AI's workarounds.

### 3. Contextual Suggestions
**Before:** "66% match" with no explanation
**After:** "Addresses: 5-10 years supervisory experience, OSHA certification"

**Rationale:** User can verify AI's logic and trust the matching.

### 4. Transparent Vault Usage
**Before:** User wonders "did it use my best stuff?"
**After:** "Used 5 vault items: [list]" with ability to expand

**Rationale:** User sees what was included and can request changes.

---

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Gap Analysis View (New Component)
```typescript
// GapAnalysisView.tsx
interface Gap {
  requirement: string;
  severity: 'critical' | 'important' | 'nice-to-have';
  nearMatches?: VaultMatch[];  // Vault items that partially match
  suggestions: string[];        // AI-generated alternatives
  userAction?: 'skip' | 'approve' | 'manual';
}
```

### Phase 2: Auto-Generation (Modified SectionWizard)
- Remove vault item checkboxes
- Remove "generate" button per section
- Generate ALL sections at once
- Show progress: "Generating section 3 of 7..."

### Phase 3: Transparency (Enhanced Review)
```typescript
// Show which vault items were used
interface SectionReview {
  sectionTitle: string;
  generatedContent: string;
  vaultItemsUsed: VaultMatch[];     // What was included
  requirementsCovered: string[];    // What it addresses
  atsKeywordsCovered: string[];     // Keywords included
}
```

## User Experience Comparison

### Current Flow (Confusing)
1. See job analysis
2. Choose format
3. **For each section:**
   - See 15 unchecked vault items
   - Wonder "should I check all of these?"
   - Check most/all of them
   - Click generate
   - Review content
4. Repeat for 7 sections

**Problems:**
- Repetitive manual selection
- No visibility into what's missing
- Can't evaluate match quality
- Same items appear in multiple sections

### New Flow (Logical)
1. See job analysis
2. Choose format
3. **Review gaps** (3-5 critical requirements)
   - See specific unmatched requirements
   - Get AI suggestions for each
   - Approve/skip/provide alternative
4. **Generate full resume** (automatic)
   - AI uses ALL matched vault items
   - Places them in appropriate sections
   - Creates dual versions
5. **Review each section**
   - See what was included and why
   - Edit if needed
   - Approve

**Benefits:**
- AI does the heavy lifting
- User focuses on gaps (actionable)
- Full transparency (can see what was used)
- One-time generation (not per section)

---

## Migration Plan

### Step 1: Add Gap Analysis View
- Create `GapAnalysisView.tsx` component
- Use existing `unmatchedRequirements` from match-vault-to-requirements
- Show gaps with AI suggestions

### Step 2: Modify Generation Logic
- Change from section-by-section to full-resume generation
- Use ALL matched vault items (not user-selected)
- Respect `suggestedPlacement` from matching function

### Step 3: Update Section Review
- Add "Vault Items Used" section
- Add "Requirements Covered" section
- Keep edit/approve functionality

### Step 4: Remove Obsolete UI
- Remove vault item checkboxes from SectionWizard
- Remove "Select All" / "Deselect All" buttons
- Simplify to review-only interface

## Design Decisions

1. **Section-by-section regeneration:** YES
   - User can regenerate individual sections if needed
   - Keeps flexibility without forcing full resume regeneration

2. **Vault items in multiple sections:** AI decides primary placement, mentions elsewhere
   - Example: "Budget management" → Primary in Experience, mentioned in Summary + Skills
   - AI uses context to determine where full detail goes vs. brief mention

3. **User disagrees with placement:** Use existing edit functionality
   - No need for special "move" feature
   - User can edit content directly if something doesn't fit

---

## Success Metrics

- **Reduced clicks:** From 50+ checkboxes to 3-5 gap approvals
- **Faster completion:** From 15 minutes to 5 minutes
- **Better coverage:** Gaps identified and addressed proactively
- **Higher trust:** Transparency into what was used and why

## 📊 Impact on Vault Quality

### Before Phase 2:
- User completes onboarding
- Dashboard shows: "Quantification: 0/15", "Modern Terms: 0/15"
- Vault Quality: 45/100
- User confused: "How do I improve these scores?"
- **No clear path to improvement**

### After Phase 2:
- User completes onboarding
- Dashboard shows low scores with "Click to improve →"
- User clicks Quantification score
- Adds metrics to 15 phrases in 10 minutes
- User clicks Modern Terms score
- Modernizes 12 phrases in 8 minutes
- **Result:**
  - Quantification: 0 → 13/15
  - Modern Terms: 0 → 12/15
  - Vault Quality: 45 → 82/100
  - Clear path from low to high quality

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management:
```typescript
// Dashboard state
const [addMetricsModalOpen, setAddMetricsModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [modernizeModalOpen, setModernizeModalOpen] = useState(false);

// Modal handlers
onClick={() => setAddMetricsModalOpen(true)}
onSuccess={() => fetchData()} // Refresh on close
```

### Data Flow:
1. User clicks score → modal opens
2. Modal fetches phrases from Supabase
3. User requests AI suggestions → Edge Function called
4. AI analyzes → returns structured JSON
5. User edits/applies changes → saved to Supabase
6. Modal closes → dashboard re-fetches data
7. Strength scores recalculated → UI updates

### AI Integration:
- Primary: Claude Sonnet 4 (best quality)
- Fallback: Gemini 2.0 Flash (faster, cheaper)
- Structured output with JSON schema
- Graceful degradation (AI fails → manual entry still works)

### Error Handling:
- AI suggestion fails → "Try manually adding..." message
- No phrases need improvement → "All phrases have metrics!" success message
- Loading states with spinners
- Toast notifications for success/error

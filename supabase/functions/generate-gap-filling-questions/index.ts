// =====================================================
// GENERATE GAP-FILLING QUESTIONS - Career Vault 2.0
// =====================================================
// INTELLIGENT GAP ANALYSIS
//
// This function identifies gaps by comparing vault contents
// against industry benchmarks and generates TARGETED questions
// that will have the highest impact on vault strength.
//
// UNIQUE VALUE:
// - Only asks questions that ADD value (not just filling forms)
// - Each question shows expected impact on vault strength
// - Prioritized by importance to target role/industry
// - Multi-format questions (multiple choice, yes/no, text)
//
// MARKETING MESSAGE:
// "We identify exactly what's missing from your profile by
// comparing against industry standards—then ask precise
// questions to close those gaps. 5-15 minutes for +10-15%
// vault strength."

Vault Strength: ${vaultSummary.overallStrength}% (${vaultSummary.completionPercentage}% complete)

Key competencies for ${vaultSummary.industry}: ${industryInsights.keyCompetencies.join(', ')}

${targetRoles ? `## Target Roles: ${targetRoles.join(', ')}` : ''}

## Your Task:

STEP 1 - ANALYZE THE RESUME:
Read the resume carefully and determine:
- What is their ACTUAL job title(s) and role(s)? (e.g., "Drilling Engineer", "Software Architect", "Registered Nurse")
- What industry/field do they work in? (e.g., "Oil & Gas", "Healthcare", "Technology")
- What is their career level? (entry-level, mid-level, senior, leadership, executive)
- What are their core technical skills and domain expertise?
- What projects, achievements, or experiences do they mention?

STEP 2 - IDENTIFY GAPS:
Based on their ACTUAL role and industry (not a generic template), identify what's MISSING that would strengthen their profile:
- What certifications or qualifications are standard in their field but not mentioned?
- What types of projects or achievements might they have done but haven't documented?
- What technical skills or tools are common in their role but not listed?
- What leadership or team experiences might be relevant to their level?
- What industry-specific accomplishments would be valuable to document?

STEP 3 - GENERATE ROLE-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
Create 5-15 questions that are HIGHLY SPECIFIC to their actual job, industry, and career level.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Questions MUST match their actual job (if they're a drilling engineer, ask about drilling operations, NOT digital transformation)
- Use terminology and concepts from THEIR industry (e.g., oil & gas professionals: "wellbore", "completions", "BOP"; not "SaaS", "API", "CI/CD")
- Match sophistication to their career level (senior engineer vs. entry-level technician)
- Ask about gaps that are REALISTIC for someone in their specific role
- NO generic business/executive questions unless they're actually in executive roles

Generate 5-15 highly targeted questions organized into logical batches. Each question should:
1. Address a SPECIFIC gap that someone in THEIR EXACT role would realistically have
2. Have measurable impact on vault strength (rate 1-10)
3. Be answerable in <2 minutes
4. Use the most appropriate question format (multiple choice, yes/no, text, scale)

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL TYPE SELECTION RULES:
- If the question text includes "Select all that apply" OR "Which of the following" (plural) → MUST use "type": "checkbox"
- If asking for a single choice from options → use "type": "multiple_choice"
- If asking yes/no → use "type": "yes_no"
- If asking for free text → use "type": "text"
- If asking for a number → use "type": "number"

IMPORTANT:
- Only ask questions where the answer is clearly MISSING or WEAK in the vault
- Prioritize questions with impactScore 7-10 (game-changers for THIS PERSON'S career level and field)
- Mix question types for better user experience
- Keep batches to 3-5 questions each for psychological momentum
- NO generic questions - every question must tie to competencies relevant to THEIR specific role and industry

QUESTION TYPE GUIDELINES:
- Use "multiple_choice" for single-selection questions (e.g., "What was the size of...")
- Use "checkbox" for multi-selection questions - ALWAYS include "(Select all that apply)" in the question text
- Use "yes_no" for binary questions
- Use "text" for open-ended narrative questions
- Use "scale" for rating/scoring questions

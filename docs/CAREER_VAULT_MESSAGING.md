# Career Vault Messaging & Copy Guidelines

This document provides canonical copy, positioning, and messaging for the Career Vault system and all related features. Use this to maintain consistent, executive-friendly language across the application, marketing materials, and user communications.

---

## Core Positioning

### Short Tagline (Hero Line)
> **Career Vault** – one master record of your experience, impact, and leadership story.

### 2–3 Sentence Explainer (Marketing / Onboarding)
> Your Career Vault is a single, accurate record of your experience, results, and strengths. You upload your resume once, answer a few focused questions, and we do the heavy lifting—quantifying accomplishments, clarifying scope, and capturing the way you actually lead. Every targeted resume, LinkedIn update, and interview prep guide is built from this vault so you don't have to start from scratch each time.

### Plain-Language Version (50+ Executives, Low-Jargon)
> Think of the Career Vault as your "master file." Instead of rewriting your career story every time you see a new opportunity, we keep your roles, achievements, and leadership examples in one place and reuse them wherever you need them.

## Onboarding Email Snippet

Use this in welcome emails:

> **What is the Career Vault?**
> Instead of rewriting your story every time you see a job posting, your Career Vault becomes your single source of truth. You upload your resume once, we organize the details, and then we refine it together with a few short questions. From there, every targeted resume, LinkedIn update, and interview prep guide is built from the same, accurate record of your experience.

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference "Career Vault"
- ✅ In feature descriptions that pull from or update vault data
- ✅ In onboarding flows to establish the concept
- ✅ In help text explaining where information comes from
- ✅ When showing the connection between features (vault → resume → LinkedIn)

### When to Keep It Implicit
- ❌ Don't say "Career Vault" in every sentence
- ❌ Once established, you can say "your experience" or "your master record"
- ❌ In micro-copy and buttons, focus on the action, not the source

### Tone Principles for 50+ Executives
1. **Calm and respectful** – no urgency, no hype
2. **Clear about what happens** – no mystery boxes
3. **Control and choice** – they stay in charge
4. **Practical, not aspirational** – focus on outcomes, not lifestyle
5. **Conversational, not technical** – "your master file" not "data repository"

## Understanding Your Vault

### Quality Tiers Explained

|------|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Gold** | 🏆 | User-verified, highest confidence | You edited or confirmed it personally |
| **Silver** | ⭐ | AI-confirmed, high confidence | You confirmed during review |

- Assumed tier = 0.4 weight
- Coverage = % of categories populated
- Freshness = Recency of updates
```

**Scoring:**
- **90-100%** - Exceptional (Top 5%)
- **80-89%** - Elite (Top 10-15%)
- **70-79%** - Strong (Top 20-25%)
- **60-69%** - Solid (Top 30-40%)
